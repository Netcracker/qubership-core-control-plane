## Introduction

This is a guide for microservice developers on Service Mesh routing. 

Service Mesh introduces a manageable smart mediator between microservices - a Gateway. By Gateway you can decouple microservices from their communication rules and control traffic between microservices. Using gateway for cross-microservice communication allows to use such features as Blue-Green rollout model, HTTP headers management, load balancing and so on. 

Microservice registration in gateway acts as microservice API publishing. When API is published - other microservices can call this REST API. 

Service Mesh is provided by two types of services: Gateways and Control-Plane. Gateway is an [envoy proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.14.3/) instance that is responsible for handling and managing HTTP requests, while Control-Plane is a central management unit for all gateways: it provides API for routes registration in all gateways and stores all the routes configurations.  

This article describes different gateway types, their purposes and different ways to register gateway routes. 

Blue-green specific requirements can be found in [Blue-Green prerequisites](#blue-green-prerequisites) section. 

There are sample scenarios with route configuration examples in [Sample configurations](#sample-configurations) section. 

## Gateway types

In order to prepare you microservice for routes registration, you need to decide which routes should be registered in which gateways. 

![Gateway roles](../images/gateway-roles.png)

There are several gateway roles:

* **Public/Private gateways**– are Ingress gateways, i.e. they route incoming traffic from outside of the cloud to pods of all families that publishes routes to internet. By default- the only way to publish API from cloud is to do it trough publuc or private gateway.
    - Public gateway should be used for APIs targeted on enduser and that will be exposed to Internet
    - Private gateway should be used for APIs targeted on internal (backoffice) staff- troubleshooters, administrators etc. And it is exposed to internal network (MZ). 
* **Facade gateway** – serves particular family (group of different versions of the same microservice) in Blue-Green routing model. 
* **Internal gateway** – is gateway “by default” – mostly it is used by cloud core, but also could be used by microservice that don’t want to have it’s own facade gateway.
    > :warning: Important: Internal gateway has NO ingress, so it is only accessible inside the cloud. Creating ingress on internal gateway manually is also prohibited due to security reasons. 
* **Composite gateway** - concept between internal and façade gateways- when one gateway serves a set of microservices and acts as API aggregator.
* **Some dedicated gateway.** Not present on a picture, but application could create additional gateways for special role. for example some integration API aggregation (ex. order submission) to expose it via firewall only dedicated set of APIs to some consumer. 
* **Egress gateway** - a dedicated gateway that is used to send requests outside of a cloud for integration purposes. It acts as a mediation between solution and external systems and deals with authentication, authorization, header routing etc.

**Public gateway**, **Private gateway** and **Internal gateway** are deployed to cloud project with the Cloud-Core application. 
Deployment of any other gateways should be explicitly configured by microservices that require these gateways. 
[Deployment configuration](#deployment-configuration) section describes how to configure deployment of the additional gateways. 

## Routing table

Routing table contains mapping upstream (incoming) request parameter on downstream (target) service version.  
The role of routing table is to define a microservice, that will serve a particular request, by the request path and version.    
Version is provided in “x-version” header.  
Routing table has version by default - it will be used when no version is specified, or when no version is found.

![routing_table](/docs/img/routing_table.png)

A very simplified representation of routing table contains the following columns:
* **Target URL**. Route published on gateway. There could be several routes at a time, and `/` wildcard is used to register any possible route of target microservice.
* **Blue-Green version**. Blue-Green version of application. Routing table compares this value with the value in header.  One version (that corresponds to Active version) is meant the default and requests w/o header will be routed to this version.
* **Cluster**. Microservice family name. Gateway could serve multiple families at a time, mostly it is common for public/private gateways and in cases when one façade gateway serves several families.
* **Endpoint**. URL of service to be called. Could be definite endpoint (as `http://a-v1:8080/api/getOrder`) or microservice root (`http://a-v1:8080`).

Control Plane contains all routing tables of all gateways and distributes changes.

## Blue-Green prerequisites

When supporting blue-green deployment schema in your microservice, 
please pay attention to few more things in addition to gateway routes registration.
Section below covers these blue-green prerequisites for you microservice. 

### Parameters and HELM charts

When using Blue-Green deployment, pay attention to these parameters provided by deployer. 

Please, check carefully that you use them correctly in your template.json, helm charts or any deploy scripts. 

* `SERVICE_NAME` - family service name (ex. `trace-service`)
* `DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME` - versioned service name (ex. `trace-service-v2`)
* `DEPLOYMENT_VERSION` - deployment version (ex. `v2`)

So you should use `DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME` where you reference to specific service (ex. deployment`s `.metadata.name`) to support BlueGreen model. 

### Deployment configuration

Deployment-configuration file contains deploy options for your microservice. Using deployment-configuration file you can configure:

1. Generation of named gateway. 
    > :information_source: Despite the amount of different gateway roles, technically all the gateways (except public, private and internal) deployed the same way. So from the deployment-configuration point of view there is no difference between configuring facade, composite or egress gateway - they all are **named gateways** in terms of deployment-configuration file.
2. Setting generated gateway HW resources. 
3. Enabling BlueGreen support. 
    > :warning: Important: All microservices within application should support bluegreen, otherwise BlueGreen deployment will be prohibited for application by deployer.  
4. Status Condition Support for Custom Resource. 

Deployment-configuration file is optional, so you can omit adding it to your service in case you do not need to configure any of these deployment settings. 

## Routes registration 

Next sections describe different ways to register microservice routes, but here is general RouteConfiguration contract. 

Take a look at this example configuration written in yaml: 
```yaml
apiVersion: nc.core.mesh/v3
kind: RouteConfiguration
metadata:
  name: tenant-manager-routes
  namespace: cloud-core
spec:
  gateways: ["public-gateway-service"]
  virtualServices:
  - name: public-gateway-service
    routeConfiguration:
      version: v1
      routes:
      - destination:
          cluster: tenant-manager
          endpoint: http://tenant-manager-v1:8080
        rules:
        - match:
            prefix: /api/v3/tenant-manager/tenants
          allowed: true
          prefixRewrite: /api/v3/tenants
        - match:
            prefix: /api/v3/tenant-manager/tenant/{tenantId}/suspend
          allowed: true
      - destination:
          cluster: site-management
          endpoint: http://site-management-v1:8080
        rules:
        - match:
            prefix: /api/v3/tenant-manager/tenant/{tenantId}/routes
          allowed: true
          prefixRewrite: /api/v3/tenant/{tenantId}/routes
      - destination:
          cluster: some-cluster
          endpoint: http://some-cluster-v1:8080
        rules:
        - match:
            prefix: /api/v1/
          deny: true
          
  - name: ...
```

Each gateway can have one or more **VirtualServices**, that are used to aggregate routes by hosts and apply common header manipulations for all these routes.

E.g. for all the **Public gateway** routes there should be only one **VirtualService** with `Hosts: ["*"]`. In case of **Composite gateway** there should be one **VirtualService** for each separate host (each microservice family).  

Each gateway **Route** always belongs to **RouteConfiguration** of concrete **VirtualService**. 

Listener port field - Specifies which port the facade/composite gateway will listen on. If it is necessary to listen to multiple ports, it should specify each port in a separate RouteConfiguration configuration
> :warning: Only facade and composite gateways support listenerPort field.

**RouteConfiguration#Version** field stands for Blue-Green deployment version. Please note, that this is not a version of any application, release, etc. - this is a version of **deployment generation**. It is not realted to any specific application, but it is related to the whole cloud namespace. 

**RouteDestination** consists of **Cluster** and **Endpoint**. 

Cluster - Microservice family name. Gateway could serve multiple families at a time, mostly it is common for public/private gateways and in cases when one façade gateway serves several families.

Endpoint - URL of service to be called. Could be definite endpoint (as `http://a-v1:8080/api/getOrder`) or microservice root (`http://a-v1:8080`)

**Route** contains **Rules** for route matching, rewriting request path prefix, headers manipulation and timeout.

**RouteMatch#Prefix** stands for prefix rule meaning that the prefix must match the beginning of the _:path_ header. Supports path variables: each variable name must be written in braces, e.g. `/api/v1/my-service/entity/{entityId}`. You can use same variable names in **Rule#PrefixRewrite** field to control variables passing when using prefixRewrite.

**RouteMatch#HeaderMatchers** contract in most cases just repeats envoy api, so refer to [envoy v1.14.3 docs](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.14.3/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-msg-route-headermatcher) for more details on each field.     


Below is the class diagram that shows how route configurations are represented for control-plane. 

[Domain](#domain) section describes this contract in details. 

![Gateway roles](../images/route-config-class.png)

### Best practices

Below are some best practices when developing with Service Mesh: 
* [Always communicate through gateway](#always-communicate-through-gateway)
* [Routes naming rules](#routes-naming-rules)

#### Always communicate through gateway

In Cloud Core we postulate that **all the network communications must be performed through Service Mesh gateways**, except the scenario demands the opposite due to some objective reasons. 

One gateway between every client and server in request chain is enough: if request from microservice A to another microservice B goes through internal-gateway, it should be forwarded from internal-gateway directly to microservice B ommiting any facade/composite gateway. 

Yes, every gateway supports Blue-Green, not only facade/composite gateways! 

There 5 **exclusions** from this rule connected to cloud-core microservice inititalization order - you should call these services directly by hostname instead of using internal-gateway: 
* identity-provider **only in case of obtaining m2m token** - other REST calls should be done through internal-gateway
* control-plane
* config-server
* dbaas-agent
* maas-agent

#### Routes naming rules

The rule below applies only to cases when prefix-based routing is used, such as: 
* public/private/internal gateway routes;
* different routes under the same virtualService in composite/egress gateway;
* routes for microservices created from "template" (in terms of Core DevOps).

The only strict rule that you should follow: any route prefix matcher must contain **unique** name of the microservice in it, so the route does not clash with any other routes of some other microservices. 

Example of correct prefix matcher: `/api/v3/control-plane/routes` - this route contains microservice name `control-plane` in prefix matcher, so it will not clash with routes of any other microservices. 

### Routing models

> :information_source: In some documents "Routing models" can be also called "Routing modes". Please, keep in mind that this is the same thing. 

Routing models added at control-plane in order to separate two functions: namespace routing (sandboxes) and blue-green. 

Accordingly, if you have registered at least one route with a namespace different from the one where control-plane is located, the model will be set to `NAMESPACED` and you will not be able to register a route with a version (for blue-green deployment). The reverse situation is also true. You can change routing model by deleting all the routes that are typical for the activated mode (for example, by deleting all the routes with namespace, you activate the intermediate-simple mode).

### Routes registration using configuration files

Microservice routes can be configured using routes-configuration file. Supported formats are json and yaml. 

This file should be placed in `<your-repository-root>/deployments/routes-configuration.<json or yaml>` or `<your-repository-root>/openshift/routes-configuration.<json or yaml>`. 

Also, Control-Plane CLI tool can be used manually to register routes from routes-configuration file. 

> :warning: **Important: It is prohibited to register\edit root route "/" on public\private\internal gateways!**  

Example routes-configuration.yaml file for microservice `trace-service` that registers some of the routes in private gateway and other routes in its own facade gateway.  

```yaml

              endpoint: http://${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}:8080
            rules:
              - match:
                  prefix: /trace-service/health

                prefixRewrite: /health
              - match:
                  prefix: /trace-service/trace
                allowed: true
                prefixRewrite: /trace
              - match:
                  prefix: /trace-service/proxy
                allowed: true
                prefixRewrite: /proxy

      hosts: ["${ENV_SERVICE_NAME}"]
      routeConfiguration:
        version: "${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_VERSION}"
        routes:
          - destination:
              cluster: "${ENV_SERVICE_NAME}"
              endpoint: http://${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}:8080
            rules:

                allowed: true
                prefixRewrite: /trace/1234
```

As you can see, routes-configuration.yaml contract requires its entries to be preceded by `---`. 

Each entry should contain fields:
* `apiVersion: nc.core.mesh/v3` - version of the API
* `kind: RouteConfiguration` - resource kind
* `metadata` containing specific RouteConfiguration name and namespace
* `listenerPort` specifies which port facade/composite gateway will listen on
* `spec.gateways` - names of gateways in which this configuration should be applied
* `spec.virtualServices` - virtual services and their routeConfigurations

Virtual service contract can be found [below](#virtualservice). 

Sample configuration files for the most common scenarios can be found in [Sample configurations](#sample-configurations) section and [here](../configs).

> :information_source: If you want to disable the registration of routes through java libs when you use a config file you can use property `apigateway.routes.registration.enabled` . 
Set it to false and routes marked with an annotation `@Route` would not be posted to gateway.

### Routes registration using Core Libraries

There several Core Libraries that allow configuring routes registration for your microservice: 
* [Quarkus Extension](#quarkus-extension)
* [Thin Java Libraries 3.X](#thin-java-libraries-3x)
* [Reactive Java Library](#reactive-java-library)
* [Pure Java](#pure-java)
* [Go Route Registration](#go-route-registration)
* [Go Microservice Core](#go-microservice-core)

#### Quarkus Extension

See route-registrator quarkus extension README https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-core-quarkus-extensions/tree/main/routes-registrator

#### Thin Java Libraries 3.X

Java Thin Libraries allow routes registration using Java annotations. 

See Spring-based route-registration library README https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-core-rest-libraries/tree/main/route-registration/README.md

#### Reactive Java Library

To enable routes registration add annotation `@EnableRoutesRegistration` in your application class. 

```java
package org.qubership.cloud.reactivesample;

import org.qubership.cloud.gateway.route.annotation.EnableRoutesRegistration;
import org.qubership.cloud.reactor.security.configuration.annotation.EnableReactiveMicroserviceSecurity;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.config.EnableWebFlux;

@EnableWebFlux
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableRoutesRegistration
@EnableReactiveMicroserviceSecurity
public class ReactiveMsApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ReactiveMsApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

Routes can be configured using `@Route`. Route type can be specified as annotation value. 
Refer to each `RouteType` javadoc to understand in which gateways route will be sent. 

Annotation `@FacadeRoute` can be used to register route in facade gateway. 

`@GatewayRequestMapping` is annotation for Class or Method to mark out microservice custom path for gateway routing. 

There is similar annotation for facade gateway custom path: `@FacadeGatewayRequestMapping`. 

See the example below. Note that all these annotations can be used to mark whether single methods, or the whole controller class. 
```java
package org.qubership.cloud.reactive.reactivesample;

import org.qubership.cloud.gateway.route.RouteType;
import org.qubership.cloud.gateway.route.annotation.FacadeRoute;
import org.qubership.cloud.gateway.route.annotation.GatewayRequestMapping;
import org.qubership.cloud.gateway.route.annotation.Route;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

@RestController
@GatewayRequestMapping("/api/v2/reactive-ms-sample/trace")
@RequestMapping("/api/v2/trace")
public class TraceController {

    @Route(RouteType.FACADE)
    @GetMapping
    private Mono<String> getFacade() {
        return Mono.just("facade route mapped to /");
    }

    @Route(RouteType.PUBLIC)
    @GetMapping("/pub")
    private Mono<String> getPub() {
        return Mono.just("public+internal+private route mapped to /pub");
    }

    @Route(RouteType.INTERNAL)
    @FacadeRoute
    @GetMapping("/mixed")
    private Mono<String> getMixed() {
        return Mono.just("internal+facade route mapped to /mixed");
    }
}
```

#### Pure Java
[route-registration-common](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-core-rest-libraries/tree/master/route-registration/route-registration-common) 
is a pure Java library that can be used to write your own routes registration library. 

Common library is suitable both for Spring and Quarkus. 

For more information refer library [README](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-core-rest-libraries/tree/main/route-registration/route-registration-common/README.md). 

#### Go Route Registration

See README of [Golang route-registration library](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-core-lib-go-rest-utils/tree/main/route-registration). 

#### Go Microservice Core

**DEPRECATED**: use [Golang route-registration library](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-core-lib-go-rest-utils/tree/main/route-registration) instead. 

> :information_source: Currently golang core library does not support facade routes registration. To register facade routes please use one of the other ways to register routes described in this document. 

`httpserver` package contains function 
```go
func (b *builder) WithGatewayRoute(
    ctx context.Context, // logging context
    from string, // 'from' path prefix - prefix to match request path in gateway
    to string, // 'to' path prefix - prefix to rewrite matched 'from' path prefix before forwarding request to the microservice
    gatewayType routemanagement.GatewayType, // gateway type: can be one of routemanagement.Public, routemanagement.Private or routemanagement.Internal
) *builder
```

See example below: 
```go
package main

import (
	...
)

var (
	ctx       = logging.CreateContextFromString("")
	appConfig = configloader.GetConfig(ctx)
)

func main() {
	httpserver.Default(ctx, appConfig).
		AllowDoubleSlash(true).
		WithEndpoints(ctx, "/api/v1", func(router *mux.Router, secure auth.AuthWrapperType) {

			router.Path("/postgresql/physical_databases").
				Methods(http.MethodPost).
				HandlerFunc(secure(ctx, apiController.HandleSettingDbOwnerRoles, RoleCloudAdmin))

			...
		}).
		WithGatewayRoute(ctx,
			"/api/v3/dbaas/postgresql/physical_databases",
			"/api/v3/postgresql/physical_databases",
			routemanagement.Private).
		ListenAndServe(ctx)
}
```

This code will register route `/api/v3/dbaas/postgresql/physical_databases` in Private gateway that will lead to `/api/v3/postgresql/physical_databases` endpoint of microservice. 

### Routes registration using REST API

Control-plane REST API described in [control-plane-api](../api/control-plane-api.md) document. 

### Control Plane Command Line Interface (CLI)

Control Plane CLI provides a better way to interact with Control Plane microservice using command line style.
This CLI is just a tiny wrapper over Control Plane REST interface.

## Routes deletion

See [Routes deletion guide](./routes-deletion-guide.md).

## Load balance and sticky session configuration

### Session stickiness via Ring hash based on header or cookie

Please note, that this load balancing mechanism can cause session re-balancing when scaling microservice pods.
If it does not suit your needs, you can use [Cookie based stateful sessions](#cookie-based-stateful-sessions)

### Cookie based stateful sessions

See [Cookie based stateful sessions guide](./cookie-based-stateful-session.md)

## Sample configurations

Below are route configuration examples for some of the most common use cases. 

* [Problem](#problem)
* [Register Public and Private routes](#register-public-and-private-routes)
* [Support Blue-Green and add Facade gateway](#support-bluegreen-and-add-facade-gateway)
* [Move from Facade gateway to Composite (Mesh) gateway](#move-from-facade-gateway-to-composite-mesh-gateway)
* [Egress gateway](#egress-gateway)
* [gRPC routes](#grpc-routes)
* [Custom ports for facade and composite gateways](#custom-ports-for-facade-composite-gateways)

### Problem

Let's say we are developing functional backend microservice called `employee-service` that provides some information about company employees. 
We need configure routes registration for our microservice. 

### Register Public and Private routes
Imagine that in our sample `employee-service` we have following REST API: 
* Public API: 
    + `/api/v1/common-info` - provides some common information about all employees
    + `/api/v1/employees/{employeeId}` - CRUD operations on the employee
* Private API: 
    + `/api/v1/employees/{employeeId}/personal-info` - provides Personal Information of the employee

We will use **routes-configuration.yaml** file to configure routes registration for the microservice. 

Put file `<repository-root>/deployments/routes-configuration.yaml` in `employee-service` repository with the following content: 
```yaml
---
apiVersion: nc.core.mesh/v3
kind: RouteConfiguration
metadata:
  name: employee-service-public-routes
  namespace: "${ENV_NAMESPACE}"
spec:
  gateways: ["public-gateway-service"]
  virtualServices:
  - name: public-gateway-service
    hosts: ["*"]
    routeConfiguration:
      version: "${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_VERSION}"
      routes:
      - destination:
          cluster: "${ENV_SERVICE_NAME}"
          endpoint: http://${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}:8080
        rules:
        - match:
            prefix: /api/v1/employee-service/common-info
          allowed: true
          prefixRewrite: /api/v1/common-info
        - match:
            prefix: /api/v1/employee-service/employees/{employeeId}
          allowed: true
          prefixRewrite: /api/v1/employees/{employeeId}
---
apiVersion: nc.core.mesh/v3
kind: RouteConfiguration
metadata:
  name: employee-service-private-routes
  namespace: "${ENV_NAMESPACE}"
spec:
  gateways: ["private-gateway-service"]
  virtualServices:
  - name: private-gateway-service
    hosts: ["*"]
    routeConfiguration:
      version: "${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_VERSION}"
      routes:
      - destination:
          cluster: "${ENV_SERVICE_NAME}"
          endpoint: http://${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}:8080
        rules:
        - match:
            prefix: /api/v1/employee-service/employees/{employeeId}/personal-info
          allowed: true
          prefixRewrite: /api/v1/employees/{employeeId}/personal-info
```

Now when `employee-service` is being deployed via cloud-deployer, cloud-deployer will read this configuration and send it to `control-plane` using `control-plane CLI` tool. 

### Support BlueGreen and add Facade gateway

It's time for us to migrate our sample `employee-service` on blue-green deployment model. 

To enable blue-green mode for microservice and create its facade gateway we need to write **deployment-configuration.yaml** file. 

Put this file in `<repository-root>/deployments/deployment-configuration.yaml` path. 
> :warning: This sample demonstrates how to create separate facade service that will serve only `employee-service`, which may be a bad decision from HW resources perspective. 
    Please, pay attention to the next example in this guide - [Move from Facade gateway to Composite (Mesh) gateway](#move-from-facade-gateway-to-composite-mesh-gateway) 
    - to minimize HW resources consumption by facade gateways.  

It should contain following data:
```yaml
deployOptions:
  generateFacadeGateway: true
  bluegreen: true
``` 
Now when `employee-service` is being deployed via cloud-deployer, cloud-deployer will create `FacadeService` CustomResource according to the provided configuration. 
`FacadeService` CustomResource creation will trigger `facade-operator` microservice to deploy our facade gateway. 

We can also change `employee-service` **routes-configuration.yaml** to add separate RouteConfiguration for facade gateway. 
Let's add `/api/v1/employee-service/internal` API that will be registered only in facade gateway and will not be accessible via Public or Private gateway.  
```yaml

        - match:

          allowed: true
          prefixRewrite: /api/v1/internal
```

### Move from Facade gateway to Composite (Mesh) gateway

By now our sample `employee-service` supports blue-green deployment schema and has its own Facade gateway. 
But we can have a lot of other microservices with facade gateways in our application. 
Each facade gateway consumes HW resources of the cloud, so we might want to join some Facade gateways into single one - into Composite gateway. 

Let's say that there is another blue-green microservice `project-asssinment-manager` - it provides API to manage employees project assignments.  
We don't want both `employee-service` and `project-asssinment-manager` to have separate facade gateways so let's join them into single composite gateway. 

To achieve that we need to perform 2 steps:
 1. Specify same gateway name in **deployment-configuration.yaml** of both microservices.
 2. Use this gateway name instead of `"${ENV_SERVICE_NAME}"` in both services **routes-configuration.yaml**. 
 
We can pick any name for new composite gateway, it just must be a valid kubernetes service name and must not collide with other service names in project.
E.g. if we decide to call new composite gateway `employee-api-gateway`, then `employee-service` and `project-asssinment-manager` **deployment-configuration.yaml** should contain the following: 
```yaml
deployOptions:
  bluegreen: true
  generateNamedGateway: employee-api-gateway
```
And **routes-configuration.yaml** of our `employee-service` will look like this: 
```yaml
---
apiVersion: nc.core.mesh/v3
kind: RouteConfiguration
metadata:
  name: employee-service-public-routes
  namespace: "${ENV_NAMESPACE}"
spec:
  gateways: ["public-gateway-service"]
  virtualServices:
  - name: public-gateway-service
    hosts: ["*"]
    routeConfiguration:
      version: "${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_VERSION}"
      routes:
      - destination:
          cluster: "${ENV_SERVICE_NAME}"
          endpoint: http://${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}:8080
        rules:
        - match:
            prefix: /api/v1/employee-service/common-info
          allowed: true
          prefixRewrite: /api/v1/common-info
        - match:
            prefix: /api/v1/employee-service/employees/{employeeId}
          allowed: true
          prefixRewrite: /api/v1/employees/{employeeId}
---
apiVersion: nc.core.mesh/v3
kind: RouteConfiguration
metadata:
  name: employee-service-private-routes
  namespace: "${ENV_NAMESPACE}"
spec:
  gateways: ["private-gateway-service"]
  virtualServices:
  - name: private-gateway-service
    hosts: ["*"]
    routeConfiguration:
      version: "${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_VERSION}"
      routes:
      - destination:
          cluster: "${ENV_SERVICE_NAME}"
          endpoint: http://${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}:8080
        rules:
        - match:
            prefix: /api/v1/employee-service/employees/{employeeId}/personal-info
          allowed: true
          prefixRewrite: /api/v1/employees/{employeeId}/personal-info
---
apiVersion: nc.core.mesh/v3
kind: RouteConfiguration
metadata:
  name: employee-service-mesh-routes
  namespace: "${ENV_NAMESPACE}"

      routes:
      - destination:
          cluster: "${ENV_SERVICE_NAME}"
          endpoint: http://${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}:8080
        rules:
        - match:
            prefix: /api/v1/employee-service/internal
          allowed: true
          prefixRewrite: /api/v1/internal
```
Cloud-deployer will create `employee-service` and `project-asssinment-manager` kubernetes services that will be backed by Composite gateway `employee-api-gateway`. Specyfing service hostname in `RouteConfiguration#virtualServices#hosts` section of **routes-configuration.yaml** allows to match VirtualServices routes only when request comes to gateway from the `employee-service` kubernetes service. 

### Move from Composite gateway to Facade gateway

> :warning: It is recommended to use a composite gateway due to higher cloud HW resources consumption of facade gateways.

In some cases, it may be necessary to split Composite gateway back into a Facade gateway for each service. This is
possible if you undo the changes made in the example
[Move from Facade gateway to Composite (Mesh) gateway](#move-from-facade-gateway-to-composite-mesh-gateway)
by replacing the specified gateway name `employee-api-gateway` with `"${ENV_SERVICE_NAME}"`
in **deployment-configuration.yaml** and **routes-configuration.yaml** files of both microservices.

See [Support BlueGreen and add Facade gateway](#support-bluegreen-and-add-facade-gateway) for files example.

### Egress gateway

In case we need to access some external resource that located outside the cloud (e.g. Google API) we should configure egress gateway. 
> :warning: Ingress (Composite or Facade) gateway must never be used for communication with external resources. Egress gateway must be a separate service on the cloud. 

Egress gateway provides several useful features: 
* **Adding custom headers**	- Enrich outgoing request with custom headers with static values. Example: Origin
* **Removing headers** -	Remove specified headers, token with auth token as example.	
* **Upstream authentication**  - basic auth, SFA - oauth2, cjm; can be done using custom WASM filters [configuration example](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-core-control-plane/tree/main/docs/configs/9_WASM_Add.yaml)
* **Audit outgoing requests**  - can be done using custom WASM filters [configuration example](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-core-control-plane/tree/main/docs/configs/9_WASM_Add.yaml)
* **Daily requests number limit** -	It helps to prevent customer ban. Audit of internal calls need to find "bad" microservice	Yes (Rate limit http filter + ext service; can be done using custom WASM filters [configuration example](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-core-control-plane/tree/main/docs/configs/9_WASM_Add.yaml)
Example ext service: https://github.com/envoyproxy/ratelimit)
* **Manage SSL certs**  -	Register external certificates. Now we have 2 options:
  * Apply config on Gateway level [Gateway level config example](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-core-control-plane/tree/main/docs/configs/11_gateway_TLS.yaml)
  * Apply config on Cluster level [Cluster level config example](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-core-control-plane/tree/main/docs/configs/8_cluster_TLS.yaml)
  
  !!! Can be specified only trustedCA or with clientCert and privateKey !!!  
  !!! Only X509 certificates in PEM encoding are accepted, private key also must be in PEM !!!

Egress gateway can be deployed by creating FacadeService CustomResource in your predeploy script: 
```shell script
ocBin=`oc311 plugin shift_plugin_caller oc_get_version --print_clientname=true`

cat << EOF | ${ocBin} --namespace="${ENV_NAMESPACE}" apply -f -
apiVersion: "qubership.org/v1alpha"
kind: FacadeService
metadata:
  name: egress-gateway
spec:
  port: 8080
EOF
```

Let's say we need to call some Google API from our service, and we also want to add some token (API key) to each request in case we don't already have _Authorization_ header. 

In **routes-configuration.yaml** we can add egress routes:
```yaml
---
apiVersion: nc.core.mesh/v3
kind: RouteConfiguration
metadata:
  name: echo-route
  namespace: ''
spec:
  gateways:
    - egress-gateway
  virtualServices:
    - name: google-service
      hosts: ["google-service"]
      removeHeaders: ["Origin", "Authorization"]
      routeConfiguration:
        routes:
          - destination:
              cluster: google
              endpoint: https://google.com
            rules:
              - match:
                  prefix: /
                  headerMatchers:
                    - name: tenant-id
                      exactMatch: cloud-common
                  addHeaders: 
                    - name: Authorization
                      value: "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c"
```  
Now all egress gateway requests will be routed to `http://google:8080`, 
`Origin` header will be removed and `Authorization` header will be added if absent to any request through this gateway.

#### Egress gateway out of the box

Since `Core 2024.4 Release` egress gateway is a part of Cloud-Core application. By default it is installed with deploying Cloud-Core. To exlude it during deploy use deployment variable: `SKIP_EGRESS_GATEWAY_CREATION` = `true`.

For memory and cpu limit settings use variables: 
| name | default value |
|------|---------------|
| EGRESS_GW_CPU_LIMIT | 100m |
| EGRESS_GW_MEMORY_LIMIT | 64Mi |

Since `Core 2025.4 Release` egress gateway can be configured with custom set of headers to remove. To use this feature set deployment variables `EGRESS_RESPONSE_HEADERS_TO_REMOVE` or `EGRESS_REQUEST_HEADERS_TO_REMOVE`. If not set the following headers will be removed from from corresponding object by default:
* "X-Forwarded-For"
* "X-Forwarded-Proto"
* "X-Forwarded-Host"
* "X-Forwarded-Port"
* "Via"
* "X-Real-IP"

"server" response header is not sent by gateway in any cases

### gRPC routes

  > :warning: Important: public-gateway and private-gateway ingresses (OpenShift routes) do not support gRPC traffic. You can still register gRPC routes in public and private gateway, but those routes will work properly only when communicating with gateway via kubernetes service inside the cloud. 

gRPC routes can be registered in any gateway. It is required to register gRPC routes with `httpVersion: 2` (see the example below). As well, you can set custom deployment parameter (ONLY FOR KUBERNETES) `GATEWAY_GRPC_INGRESS_ENABLED=true;` to deploy grpc public and private gateway ingresses.

By gRPC notation request path is the fully-qualified gRPC service function name,
e.g. if gRPC service is define by protobuf:
```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package org.qubership.sample.event.bus.v3;

import "google/protobuf/any.proto";

service EventBus {
  rpc Subscribe(Topic) returns (stream Event) {}
}
...
```
full HTTP/2 request path will be `/org.qubership.sample.event.bus.v3.EventBus/Subscribe`.

So for this case we can register HTTP/2 route in gateway:
```yaml
---
apiVersion: nc.core.mesh/v3
kind: RouteConfiguration
metadata:
  name: employee-service-public-routes
  namespace: "${ENV_NAMESPACE}"
spec:
  gateways: ["public-gateway-service"]
  virtualServices:
    - name: public-gateway-service
      hosts: ["*"]
      routeConfiguration:
        version: "${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_VERSION}"
        routes:
          - destination:
              cluster: "${ENV_SERVICE_NAME}"
              endpoint: http://${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}:8080
            rules:
              - match:
                  prefix: /api/v1/employee-service
                prefixRewrite: /api/v1/
          - destination:
              cluster: "${ENV_SERVICE_NAME}"
              endpoint: http://${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}:5431
              httpVersion: 2
            rules:
              - match:
                  prefix: /org.qubership.sample.event.bus.v3.EventBus
                allowed: true
                timeout: 600000
```
As you can see, there are two different destinations in this example: REST API on port 8080 and gRPC API on port 5431.
We need to specify `httpVersion` fo gRPC endpoint explicitly since by default `httpVersion` is `1`.
In this particular example two different endpoints will be registered in control-plane with different HTTP versions.

The same endpoint cannot serve both HTTP 1.1 and HTTP/2, so if you have both REST and gRPC API on the same port (e.g. 8080), you need to register two different destinations with different cluster names and same endpoint address, like in the example below: 
```yaml
---
apiVersion: nc.core.mesh/v3
kind: RouteConfiguration
metadata:
  name: employee-service-public-routes
  namespace: "${ENV_NAMESPACE}"
spec:
  gateways: ["public-gateway-service"]
  virtualServices:
    - name: public-gateway-service
      hosts: ["*"]
      routeConfiguration:
        version: "${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_VERSION}"
        routes:
          - destination:
              cluster: "${ENV_SERVICE_NAME}"
              endpoint: http://${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}:8080
            rules:
              - match:
                  prefix: /api/v1/employee-service
                prefixRewrite: /api/v1/
          - destination:
              cluster: "${ENV_SERVICE_NAME}-h2"
              endpoint: http://${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}:8080
              httpVersion: 2
            rules:
              - match:
                  prefix: /org.qubership.sample.event.bus.v3.EventBus
                allowed: true
                timeout: 600000
```

For gRPC streaming it might be useful to configure route `timeout` (in milliseconds). By default, timeout for each route is 2 minutes.

### Custom ports for facade composite gateways

Facade and composite gateways support custom ports

In order for the gateway to be able to listen and respond on custom ports, you need to do the following:
* **Specify ports in service** - Specify the required ports in the service yaml
```yaml
---
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: "{ENV.DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}"
  annotations:
    qubership.cloud/start.stage: '1'
spec:
  ports:
    - name: web
      port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
    - name: web2
      port: 1234
      targetPort: 1234
  selector:
    name: "{ENV.DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}"
```
* **Specify ports in deployment/deployment config** - Specify the required ports in the deployment/deployment config yaml
```yaml
---
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: "{ENV.DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}"
  labels:
    name: "{ENV.DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}"
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: "{ENV.DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}"
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: "{ENV.DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}"
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: "{ENV.SERVICE}"
          ports:
            - name: web
              containerPort: 8080
              protocol: TCP
            - name: web2
              containerPort: 1234
              protocol: TCP
```

* **routes-configuration.yaml** - Add routes-configuration.yaml and specify the required ports in the listenerPort field and TLS support in tlsSupported field (true or false). Specify each port in a separate RouteConfiguration. ListenerPort is the port that the gateway listen on. Endpoint is the service to which gateway will redirect the request. If you specified support for tls and tls is enabled, then https protocol will be used, otherwise http

              - match:
                  prefix: /trace-service/trace/1234
                allowed: true
                prefixRewrite: /trace/1234
```

### TLS support in microservice
In order for the routes to work in TLS mode, you need to do the following steps:
1) Enable TLS in the service
2) To register routes, you just need to add two new fields tlsEndpoint and tlsSupported in **routes-configuration.yaml**. Specify your TLS endpoint in tlsEndpoint. The endpoint field will still be used if TLS is disabled or tlsSupported: false, this field should not change when you enable TLS in your microservice.
```yaml
---
apiVersion: nc.core.mesh/v3
kind: RouteConfiguration
metadata:
  name: employee-service-public-routes
  namespace: "${ENV_NAMESPACE}"
spec:
  gateways: ["public-gateway-service"]
  tlsSupported: ${ENV_INTERNAL_TLS_ENABLED}
  virtualServices:
    - name: public-gateway-service
      hosts: ["*"]
      routeConfiguration:
        version: "${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_VERSION}"
        routes:
          - destination:
              cluster: "${ENV_SERVICE_NAME}"
              endpoint: http://${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}:8080
              tlsEndpoint: https://${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}:8443
            rules:
              - match:
                  prefix: /api/v1/employee-service
                prefixRewrite: /api/v1/
```
3) If you are registering routes in facade or composite gateways using custom ports, you need to specify the custom port in the listenerPort field and specify tls support in tlsSupported field. If you specified support for tls and tls is enabled, then https protocol will be used, otherwise http
```yaml

apiVersion: nc.core.mesh/v3
kind: RouteConfiguration
metadata:
  name: trace-service-mesh-routes
  namespace: "${ENV_NAMESPACE}"
spec:
  gateways: [ "trace-services-gateway" ]
  listenerPort: 1234
  tlsSupported: ${ENV_INTERNAL_TLS_ENABLED}
  virtualServices:
    - name: "${ENV_SERVICE_NAME}"
      hosts: ["${ENV_SERVICE_NAME}"]
      routeConfiguration:
        version: "${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_VERSION}"
        routes:
          - destination:
              cluster: "${ENV_SERVICE_NAME}"
              endpoint: http://${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}:1234
              tlsEndpoint: https://${ENV_DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME}:1234
            rules:
              - match:
                  prefix: /trace-service/trace/1234
                allowed: true
                prefixRewrite: /trace/1234
```
### Custom Host Header Rewrite in Gateways

When forwarding request to upstream, envoy writes request header 'Host' that contains target hostname and port in format `<host>:<port>`. 

While RFC 7230 declares such format for header 'Host', some systems may fail to process request due to default http/https port specified explicitly in this header.

For such cases Service Mesh provides capability to set custom 'Host' header value for specific routes. 

**Example**

To customize `Host` header value you need to sepcify desired value in `hostRewrite` rule for gateway route. This field can contain any string value: you can specify or ommit port, you can specify hostname different from the one that used as target address, etc. 


```yaml
---
apiVersion: core.qubership.org/v1
kind: Mesh
subKind: RouteConfiguration
metadata:
  name: sample-egress-route
  namespace: my-namespace
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: saasDeployer
    deployer.cleanup/allow: "true"
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: "my-application"
    app.kubernetes.io/processed-by-operator: "core-operator"   
spec:
  gateways: ["egress-gateway"]
  virtualServices:
    - name: "my-target-system"
      hosts: ["my-target-system"]
      routeConfiguration:
        routes:
          - destination:
              cluster: "my-target-system.com"
              endpoint: https://my-target-system.com:443
            rules:
              - match:
                  prefix: /
                hostRewrite: my-target-system.com
```

### Control Plane Metrics

Control Plane provides Prometheus metrics to monitor the expiry and validity of managed TLS certificates. Two metrics are defined:

- `certificate_days_to_expiry`: Gauge metric that tracks the number of days remaining before a TLS certificate expires.
- `certificate_valid`: Gauge metric that indicates the current validity status of a TLS certificate (1 for valid, 0 for invalid).

These metrics are labeled by `tls_def` and `cert_common_name`. They are updating every 24 hours.

```
# HELP certificate_days_to_expiry Number of days until certificate expiry
# TYPE certificate_days_to_expiry gauge
certificate_days_to_expiry{cert_common_name="leaf cert",tls_def="erp-gateway-level"} 363
certificate_days_to_expiry{cert_common_name="root ca",tls_def="erp-gateway-level"} 363
# HELP certificate_valid Certificate validity status (1 for valid, 0 for invalid)
# TYPE certificate_valid gauge
certificate_valid{cert_common_name="leaf cert",tls_def="erp-gateway-level"} 0
certificate_valid{cert_common_name="root ca",tls_def="erp-gateway-level"} 1
```
